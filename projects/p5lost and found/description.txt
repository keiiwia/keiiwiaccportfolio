My partner was Elaine, whose object was a diamond flower necklace. 

The description she provided was as follows: "A diamond flower necklace, the petals of which are at different elevations." 

I am assuming that the flower necklace was a simple flower design, with diamonds in the middle of each flower petal, and the flower pendant/charm was on a small chain. Hence, the "poppy" style of flower with 5 petals.
